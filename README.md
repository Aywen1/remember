# 📝 Remember
**Concept:** Improvident is a a software to centralize your revision sheets for each of your classes in one place.

## 📜 Context
**This software has an important backstory!** I coded it when I was very young, and I haven't made any changes to it since then. Because of this:

- It might not be compatible with the latest versions of Minecraft.
- There could be errors or glitches.
- The code might not be the best or the most efficient (little me has never taken a programming course).

I decided to release this software as a part of a series on my YouTube channel [Aywen](https://www.youtube.com/@aywenvideos). In the series, I explore and test the programs I coded during my childhood. The decision to release some of these programs is to give my community the chance to improve them and make them functional.

If there are promising or functional versions of my software developed by the community, I'll be showcasing them in a video on my channel! 📽️
